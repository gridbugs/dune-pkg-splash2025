\title{\bf OCaml Package Management with (only!) Dune}

    \noindent
    The OCaml build system Dune keeps track of a project's dependencies on
    external software packages however historically has been unable to download
    or install these packages, relying on additional tools to perform these
    functions. This complicated the development of projects in OCaml as users
    needed to be fluent in both Dune as well as an additional tool (usually
    Opam) to manage a project's dependencies. Recent work on Dune has added
    package management capabilities directly to the build system, enabling
    workflows where Dune is the only tool necessary to develop software in
    OCaml.

    \noindent
    This talk will showcase Dune's new package management features by
    developing an OCaml program starting from a bare system with no OCaml
    tooling installed.
